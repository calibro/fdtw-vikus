It is the last folio (f. 20r) of a translation of Plato's Timaeus by Calcidius, and it precedes a treatise on computus. The Timaeus was an indispensable work for the philosophy of music in the Middle Ages (and Calcicius' partial translation from Greek had a significant impact); scales had not only a mathematical meaning, but also a metaphysical relationship to beauty and order. The study of musical harmony was taught in the quadrivium in conjunction with astronomy because it was considered intimately connected to the movements of astral bodies and even with personality traits (idiotetes).
Diagrams of musical intervals normally contain depictions of distances (numeric, between notes), types (tones and semitones) and harmonics (notes played at the same time) on a scale. They have been used in Music Theory since classical times (the first account of the relationship between precise distances in pitch can be traced to Pythagoras) and assumed two main visual representations: triangles (called Lambda Diagrams) and spheres; assuming a direct relationship to philosophical concepts - namely natural philosophy - and, during the Middle Ages, they conveyed also religious exegeses. 
In this case, we have a laid down triangle containing information related to Pythagorean number series on the inside (chosen by Calcidius to illustrate density of sound), and musical intervals on the outside, positioned as orthogonal labels, such as diapente (every fifth) or diapason (octave).

According to an ancient philosophical theory, the motion of celestial bodies is something akin to music (the so called “musica universalis”) because of the proportions between the spheres. The ""music"" is not audible, but rather a mathematical concept. The structure of the cosmos is represented as a musical scale: the seven notes on the musical scale were associated with the planets, which were calculated to move at speeds that had the same relationship with each other as the notes of the musical scale. The intervals of the planets obeyed numerical proportions, existing cosmic harmony.
The spacing of the planets follows the Pythagorean tuning, and hence the diagram contains references to his terminology. Thus, the interval between the Earth and the sphere of the fixed stars was considered to be a diapason; from the sphere of the Earth to the sphere of the Moon, one tone; from the sphere of the Moon to that of Mercury, one-half tone; from Mercury to Venus, one-half tone; from Venus to the Sun one and one-half tones; from the Sun to Mars one tone; from Mars to Jupiter one-half tone; from Jupiter to Saturn one-half tone; from Saturn to the fixed stars one-half tone.

To treat specific health problems, particular points on the human body could lead to the solutions: by incising (cutting) a vein and just letting the blood flow into a container. The drawing of a naked man shows the location of the major blood vessels in the human body, the appropriate points for bloodletting, and more information is given by summaries highlighted in circular diagrams connected to those points by red lines.

It is a woodcut printed on folio 45v, fourth chapter of Distinctio 8 of Tractatus primi: 'quas regiones gubernant signa et planetae', from an incunabular copy of Eschuid’s fourteenth century Summa astrologiae. On top there is a note reminding the author of the existence of retrograde planetary motions, ruled by the sun and the moon; its influence in planetary hours calculations and planets' influence on all people on Earth. It is thus not a geographical or coordinate map, and so there is no spatial reference to reality, for example: white Spain, Italy or Greece are located in the West vector, Palestine is located in the South and Libya to the North-East.

The diagram is designed in a class/sequence notation with connectors. It starts by presenting types of tones, that are conjoined in Arsis and Thesis corresponding to opposite parts of musical measure, derived from Greek musica theory and was applied also to poetic metres and word-prosody. From them derive two other main branches: Similiter and Dissimiliter, with the various qualities of sound.

The Cube of Properties is a diagram that establishes relationships between shared and distinct properties of the four elements, using the position of each inside specific parts of a cube to make it visually explicit. A diagonal line crosses the oblique projection, connecting to lower-left front corner to the upper-right back corner, disrupting the perspective, but enabling Elements to sit inside triangles, where each corner represents a property. In this manner, elements (or the sides of the triangles) sometimes touch (where they share properties) and sometimes do not (where they have opposite properties)
The precise shape and verbal information on these diagrams varied in some copies, in this case for example, the Sun is labelled as an enneagon, and the Moon as an heptagon (although they are both round circles); and in manuscript BSB Clm 14300, fol. 7v.

The cervus is one of many classificatory diagrams with animals present in this book. These diagrams aim to help students (monks) learn divine and secular subjects providing further explanations of Liber I. This particular image systemizes five topica, or arguments for disputations: ex persona and ex naturae auctoritate to the left, ex dictis factisque maiorum and ex tormentis to the right, and in the middle of the compostition, bellow the body of the cervus we find ex temporis auctoritate and the means by which it has been exercised in the past, and how it is an important testimony for the future: ingeni, opibus, aetate, fortuna, arte, usu, necessitate and concursio fortuitorum. Cassiodorus concludes that nature is considered the greatest authority, or maxima virtute.
The iconography of the cervus, or stag, is linked to Christian conversion through Saint Eustace. It also symbolises devotion and regeneration, and ultimately, the light of Christ. There are at least two more manuscript copies of the Institutiones by Cassiodorus which contain the same diagram within the image of a cervus: an 8th century copy from Montecassino, at Staatsbibliothek, Bamberg; and a Lotharingian manuscript from the 9th century, at the British Library.",https://iiifmanifests.ifilosofia.up.pt/image-server/iiif/2/22e825ee-754c-427a-9778-9a17cb8b9f8e_Cervus%20Diagram.jpg,"Giulia Orofino, 'Da Montecassino a Nonantola: La tradizione illustrativa delle Institutiones di Cassiodoro', in Il monachesimo italiano dall'eta longobarda all'eta ottoniana (secc.

The Kalendarium, dedicated to Joan Princess of Wales, is, in general, attributed to him, but the authorship of the entire work is disputed. It may be that the canons and the different tables and illustrations were adapted and added by different hands. The diagrams and drawings in this parchment manuscript, c. 275x180mm, written in gothic script, are also present in subsequent copies of the text, which amount to over forty known codices and fragments. The Kalendarium is one of the many examples of how scholars at that period considered astrology and medicine to be interweaved. 
In this manuscript, f.34v contains six volvelles, each with a rotating pointer still attached (using a cord). In some copies (such as the MS. Savile 39) volvelles were also used as a complement to the Zodiac Man (the best known diagram in Somer's copies) in order to calculate the best time for certain medical procedures. In this case, the volvelles contain short references to Marian antiphons and other hymns. They are composed of an outer circle (individual hymns) and an inner circle (identifying the source and/or the liturgical setting). The first volvelle has an outer circle with the numbers 1 to 27, possibly referring to what is now known as the Murbach hymns. Antiphons were traditionally sung before and after the psalms, but since the thirteenth century they began to be performed separately. The Franciscan order conducted a reformation of chant books for liturgy during the thirteenth century, which might indicate the necessity Somer found in including these diagrams in order to help friars navigate the liturgical calendar.",https://iiifmanifests.ifilosofia.up.pt/image-server/iiif/2/89d79e24-21c2-4933-bd21-6b46e6ff59c8_Hymn%20Volvelles.jpg,"The Kalendarium of John Somer, ed. by Linne R.

Two sesquialtern (sesqualter) ratios (12:8 and 9:6) are diapente consonant intervals: the 12 to 8 and 9 to 6 gives the fifth or the diapente. The ratio of 9 to 8 is a tone (tonus). Musical intervals can therefore be expressed as numerical ratios.
Two human figures tell the myth of the origin of music: Tubalcain (a biblical character) and Pythagoras (the pagan equivalent). The Book of Genesis attributes to Jubal the invention of music and to his half-brother Tubalcain the working of metals; nevertheless, in the Middle Ages, the latter was considered the inventor of music. In the image, a blacksmith can be seen with Pythagoras creating sounds by hitting a piece of metal with four hammers.

The Horologium diagram contains information about the moonlight, the sun and zodiacal constellations, and the size of the sun’s shadow during daylight. It is a geometrical composition, made out of circular lines that form intersections at some points. There are three main connected circles: on top left, the first circle is divided into six sections, each of which contains 5 sequential moon ages (from 1 to 30) used here to calculate moonlight; on top right the circle is divided into 12 intersecting sections (resulting in 4 sub categories) used to calculate hours the sun enters the zodiac signs in each month.

The diagram and its textual content were written in brown and red ink and atramentum, in uncial script.
Rotae schemata were popular during the Middle Ages; they were the preferred vehicles of knowledge transmission because they could present information in a clear, and at the same time, conceptual fashion. The circle is a God-like perfect shape, it represents the cycles of nature and it enhances memory capabilities. Beda's system for calculating Easter, marked by the correct definition of embolisms and epact sequences, would be the reference for the following centuries. Abbo de Fleury's is a refinement of his system.

The “latitude” was the name given by natural philosophers to the range of degrees (the degree of a certain quality at each point) that the intensities of a quality might have and Oresme uses a method of figuring out the latitude of forms. A quality has a latitudo and a longitudo: the intensity of the quality is represented by lines (called latitudes) erected perpendicular to a base line segment called longitude of the same quality. So, there is only one longitude with an infinite number of latitudes. The end points of the latitudes form the graph, the summit line.

Those four bodily fluids, in a proportioned mixture, were considered to be essential to the physiological functioning of the organism; however, an excess or lack of one of the humours would cause imbalance. For instance, a predominant production of yellow bile would render a person choleric.

At the bottom, a male human body stretches his limbs merging them with the roots of the Tree. Each limb symbolises a Principle of the Soul: spontaneum; consultations; elections; voluntarium. From the base of the trunk a small child emerges: Free-will. Further up, the trunk contains twelve iconographic images of virtues, of which the top four are the Cardinal Virtues, in the following order: Comitas; Affabilitas; Veritas; Mansuetudo; Modestia; Magnanimitas; Magnificentia; Liberalitas; Temperantia; Fortitudo; Iustitia; and Prudentia. Twenty-four vices’ branches spring from the trunk, twelve to the left and twelve to the right; two vices per virtue: to the left, vices performed by an excess of virtue, and to the right  those performed by a defect of virtuous conduct. The top of the trunk culminates with the three theological virtues, Fides, Charitas and Spes, that are being coronated by an angel representing Human Happiness.

Geomancy’s method – one of the most popular forms of divination during the Middle Ages – allows to interpret the meanings of patterns drawn on the ground or other flat surface by means of tossed handfuls of sand or similar granular materials (like soil and rocks).
The technique requires introspection (to read the figure's energy) and consists of discovering the past, the present and the future by interpreting figures of even or odd points placed in particular locations in a shield chart, formed by a randomized process. There are sixteen geomantic figures and each can be interpreted in various ways, depending on the question and the method used to generate the tables of points. Each figure or pattern has a name, associations with the elements (and each figure has a ruling element, which can be more or less difficult to assign) and planets, good or bad qualities, stable or mobile quality, etc.
As shown in the diagrams, each figure is composed of four lines containing either one or two points. Each line represents one of the four classical elements: from top to bottom, the lines represent fire, air, water, and earth. The elements can be combined differently and the element is active if the line has a single point, and passive if there’s two points.",https://iiifmanifests.ifilosofia.up.pt/image-server/iiif/2/2afd7dd8-a3cf-4ff5-96d5-ca3d11c76005_diagramas%20geomancia.jpg,

In the widest or spherical part of the flask, just in the centre, a larger roundel than the other eight that surround it can be seen, all of them containing inscriptions around their borders. The central roundel presents two men (one younger and one much older) holding a thick and heavy book, since it is almost their height, from which chains are connected to seven of the roundels around it. Written in capital letters, the following ideas are highlighted: “Anima”, “Corpus”, “Spiritus”, “Aqua”, being some of them repeated. In seven of the roundels above mentioned, different alchemical stages of transformation are represented (with clear references to “White”, “Black” and “Solutio”), with human figures (clearly of different ages and both genders) carrying out experiments in a large flask containing homunculi atop a furnace.

The first image shows an old doctor sitting, with one hand holding knowledge and the other touching the arm of an assistant, getting his attention and instructing him how to prepare the medication in a pot plus a long stick or wooden spoon.
The second image has the caption “Epilepticus sic curabitur” on top and shows two old doctors with work instruments looking at each other with a serious complexion, about to perform together a concerted operation on the head of a patient. The patient has his eyes open (in this century, anesthesia had not yet been invented), is already bleeding and is immobilized with his hands tied behind his back and a foot ""trapped"" by the foot of one of the doctors. “The way to cure an epileptic” would involve then a surgery (trepanation – the opening of the skull and removal of the cause of the epilepsy) and cauterization, medical procedures which the patient is, in this image, undergoing jointly.
The two last miniatures address the same medical practice: cauterization. In the third image, the doctor is seen sitting in the center, surrounded by two patients portrayed with cautery points marked on the body. For example, above patient furthest down, there is a caption which reads “Ad dolorem capitis et mania incenditur sic”. Both epilepsy and mania were thought to be psychopathologies caused by the imbalance of the humours: in these cases, an excess of black bile. As can be read in medieval texts,  “maniacus est insanus” or “mania, id est, mentis alienacio”, and that is why the visual representation of the maniac is giving him the appearance of insane: hair raised in the air, and physical gestures associated with being hyperactive (restless hands). The fourth image shows the doctor on the left holding the arm of one of the patients, placing the instrument of cautery on one of the points on the patient's body, and it reads “Ad dolorem capitis et prefocationem stomachi incenditur sic”.",https://iiifmanifests.ifilosofia.up.pt/image-server/iiif/2/55390333-c424-4bb2-9802-6ee9e72a2144_Tratamentos%20me%CC%81dicos%20vf.jpg,

The world map, or circle of the Lands, is located after f. 63, inside 'De ecclesia et sinagoga' (f. 58-77v); it occupies two facing sheets and is decorated with vibrant colours (dark blue, red, black, yellow) and labelled in light brown in a visigothic hand. The drawing style is Mozarabic with Romanesque influence. Such as in other TO Maps, most influenced by Isidorus and Beatus himself, the world is encircled by water and the land is divided in three main regions (Asia, Europe and Africa), Adam and Eve are depicted in the East, between the Holy Land and India; there are also depictions of the 12 Winds, the Mediterranean Sea and main rivers, as well as small icons and written labels for geological features and cities.",https://iiifmanifests.ifilosofia.up.pt/image-server/iiif/2/39f9e052-3ec2-4e77-b9b7-c0ce4dd6f8e1_T-O%20Map.jpg,"Mundo, A.M. y Sanchez Mariana, M.

Mnemonic hands were an established graphical form that facilitated memorisation, especially visible in ecclesiastical books throughout the Middle Ages. This form of diagrams was suitable for a variety of contents, associating each finger (and/or knuckles/carpal bones) with one word, verse, calculation, etc., making it easy to remember quantities, order and frequency of the information. For example, on the first two hands, each metacarpal bone is associated with one interrogative adverb: quod, quare, quantum, quomodo and quasque, on the subject of the Fear of God and Love of God, then, each phalange contains the answers (3 per finger). Remnants of these strategies are still used today such as the counting of the knuckles to determine/remember the length (number of days) of each month.",https://iiifmanifests.ifilosofia.up.pt/image-server/iiif/2/1cb4f204-deac-4329-b473-a6432b8df31f_Mnemonic%20Hands.jpg,"de Martel, G., Repertoire des textes latins relatifs de Ruth (VIIe-XVe s.), Instrumenta Patristica 18 (Steenburg, 1990).

By turning the wheel even further, the king will end up falling, having been unable to remain clinged to the wheel, given his weight and the speed with which it can rotate. In these tribulations, the king also loses his footwear.

During the classical period of the medical tradition, and for centuries in the development of medicine, anatomy was dominated by the descriptive and authoritative texts of the physician Galen, without the use of illustrations. The evolutionary process of anatomical illustration during the Late Middle Ages until the Renaissance is due to the advent of human dissection practice in the 13th and 14th centuries, in European universities, where medicine was one of the subjects taught. Dissecting human cadavers would show the relevant parts of the body and improve the precision of human anatomical knowledge. Pictorial representation of anatomy started with the performance of human cadaveric dissection, and anatomical drawings of the early Renaissance started out more artistic than scientific – as this simple image shows, with some internal organs drawn as a series of semi-abstract shapes, but nevertheless identifiable symbols for what lies beneath the skin.",https://iiifmanifests.ifilosofia.up.pt/image-server/iiif/2/04d1e971-b544-44f9-a4b0-6cfc739afc31_orgaos%20abdomen%20torax.jpg,

This particular globe diagram contains references to the poles, tropical and equinoctial circles, regions, countries, cities and rivers, placed according to generic geographical references, and the seven climates. Words are written horizontally, vertically and obliquely and some even upside down, in a gothic hand (pre-secretary). The fact that the south-pole is nearly empty attests for the lack of knowledge of the world beyond European, near-Asian and northern African continents. In fact, the first European to sail beyond the Cape of Good Hope (southernmost tip of Africa) was the Portuguese Bartolomeu Dias, in 1488.
